15. Write a Python function that prints a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 5 and the values are cubes of the keys.
                                                                              code :
                                                                              
dict_ionary=dict()
for i in range (1,6):       # i represent index here, and range is 1 to 5 as it will not include 6. 
    dict_ionary[i] = i**3  
print(dict_ionary)
