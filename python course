BEFORE I START REMEMBER SOME POINTS.
#hashtag or (""" """) is used to comment in python,when you run the code,your python operator will see it as comment...
WHAT IS LIST ? 
list = [] #ANYTHING WRITTEN INSIDE SQUARE BRACKETS IS CONSIDER AS LIST E.G list = [2eede,2]
WHAT IS TUPLE ?
tuple =() #ANYTHING WRITTEN INSIDE ROUND BRACKETS IS CONSIDER ASTUPLE E.G tuple = (2eede,12,23)
WHAT IS SET ?
set = {} #ANYTHING WRITTEN INSIDE CURLY BRACKETS IS CONSIDER AS SET E.G set = {2eede,0,1}
WHAT IS DICTIONARY?
dict={} #ANYTHING WRITTEN INSIDE CURLY BRACKETS IS CONSIDER AS DICTIONARY + it has unique keys values  E.G dict={'hi' : 2,'to' : 3} 
WHAT IS STRING ?
str =('a')or ("A") #ANYTHING IN QUOTES IS CONSIDER AS STRING 'a' or "A"
NOW WE WRITE SOME CODES :
print("hello python") or print("hellopython") or print('hello python') #PRINT IT AND SEE THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF and  double quote or single quote( its your choice )
print("hello\npython") #\n means new line 
print('hello\spython') #\s means space 
print('hello','python') #HERE COMMA (,) REPRESENT SPACE ,YOU WILL SEE IT WHEN YOU WRITE IT LIKE THIS ;)
print("hello\tpython") #\t means tab 
print("hello\n\tpython") #\n means new line and \t means tab 
REMEBER ONE THING DONT GIVE SPACE BEFORE print()
